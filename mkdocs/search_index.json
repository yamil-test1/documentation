            "text": "Intro to Islandora CLAW\n\n\nIslandora CLAW is the project name for development of Islandora to work with Fedora 4, also known as Islandora 7.x-2.x. To fully understand Islandora CLAW, it is best to start by looking at its contrasts to the previous version of Islandora, known as 7.x-1.x. \n\n\nIslandora 7.x-1.x works as a bridge between Drupal 7.x and Fedora 3. Put simply, Islandora 7.x-1.x is middleware between Fedora 3 and Drupal 7.x, sometimes expressed as a hamburger:\n\n\nIslandora 7.x-1.x (with Fedora 3)\n\n\n\n\nIslandora CLAW (or Islandora 7.x-2.x) does more than simply replace that base layer with Fedora 4. It is a total re-architecting of the interaction between the various pieces. Rather than a hamburger, Islandora CLAW is a chimera:\n\n\nIslandora CLAW (with Fedora 4)\n\n\n\n\nOr, for a diagram that doesn't involve food or animals: \n\n\n\n\nThis new structure has several advantages:\n\n\n\n\nParcelling out the various services and dependencies allows for more horizontal scalability\n\n\nChanging the relationship between Drupal and Fedora allows for a more flexible approach to front-end management (i.e, it need not be Drupal) while also taking much greater advantage of features available from Drupal (i.e, Fedora objects are treated more like nodes, for the purposes of using Drupal contrib modules. Many Islandora 7.x-1.x modules are redundant in Islandora CLAW because they reproduce existing Drupal contrib modules that can be used out of the box in Islandora CLAW).\n\n\nEasier to keep up-to-date as not all pieces must be versioned together.\n\n\nInstallations tools (Ansible, Docker, Vagrant) can automate uniting the pieces in a simple, clean installation process. Islandora has always been a turn-key repository solution, in the sense that it needs no customization once installed. With Islandora CLAW, that installation process is much smoother, with automated solutions that can be used in production.\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem\n\n\nAlpaca\n\n\nEvent driven middleware based on Apache Camel that synchronizes Fedora 4 with Drupal.\n\n\nChullo\n\n\nA PHP client for Fedora 4 built using Guzzle and EasyRdf.\n\n\nCLAW\n\n\nA container with references to all of the other components that make up Islandora CLAW. Also contains documentation and project discussions.\n\n\nCrayfish\n\n\nTop level container for the various Islandora CLAW microservices.\n\n\nIslandora\n\n\nThe Drupal modules associated with CLAW. Work is underway to have this as a project on \ndrupal.org\n.\n\n\nPDX\n\n\nTop level container for the various PCDM specific Islandora CLAW microservices.\n\n\nWhy Switch?\n\n\nIslandora 7.x-1.x is a tried and tested product with a vibrant user and contributor community and many tools and add-ons available to customize and expand its uses. Islandora CLAW is a major departure, representing a great deal of work both in development of the software, and to migrate and upgrade existing Islandora sites. So why make the change?\n\n\nFedora\n\n\nThe primary motive for moving to Islandora CLAW is to stay current with the repository layer of our ecosystem. Moving to Fedora 4 is vital for the long-term utility of the project.\n\n\n\n\nFedora 3 is End-of-Life and has not been supported since 2015. This means that there will be no improvements, bug fixes, or security patches released for the software, drastically increasing individual maintenance needs for adopters. \n\n\nFedora 3 experiences significant slowdown when repositories reach a large (millions) number of objects. Fedora 4 is much more scalable, and is specifically engineered to be horizontally scalable in ways that Fedora 3 cannot.\n\n\n\n\nDrupal\n\n\nDrupal 8\n has been officially released and development has begun on Drupal 9. Official Drupal policy will see Drupal 7 become unsupported when Drupal 9 is released, putting it in the same precarious territory as Fedora 3. \n\n\nThe initial phases of Islandora CLAW development worked with Drupal 7 as a front-end, but Islandora CLAW has been architected with a pivot to Drupal 8 in mind from its very inception. As of June, 2016, Islandora CLAW development has pivoted fully to Drupal 8, ensuring that when the Islandora Community is ready to make the move, there will be a version of Islandora that functions with the latest and best-supported versions of both our front-end and repository layers by pairing Drupal 8 with Fedora 4.\n\n\nCommunity-Driven Design\n\n\nThe Islandora community has grown significantly since the project began, both in terms of users and contributors. For the first time, we are in a position to have a truly community-driven development process, in which any Islandora user can participate at whatever level fits their interests and abilities. Islandora CLAW has worked with the broader Islandora community to solicit use-cases, put forward prospectuses and project plans for review and editing, and has been developed with a mix of funding from Islandora Foundation members and volunteer developers working on sprints.\n\n\nIslandora CLAW is developed \nby\n the Islandora community, \nfor\n the Islandora community. As a member of the Islandora community, you can help to steer the direction it takes.\n\n\nLinked Data\n\n\nLinked Data is a big concept. A \ndefinition by Tim Bernes-Lee\n from 2006 articulates the basic idea in the context of the \"Semantic Web\":   \n\n\n\n\nIt is about making links, so that a person or machine can explore the web of data. With linked data, when you have some of it, you can find other, related, data.\n\n\nLike the web of hypertext, the web of data is constructed with documents on the web. However, unlike the web of hypertext, where links are relationships anchors in hypertext documents written in HTML, for data they links between arbitrary things described by RDF. The URIs identify any kind of object or concept. But for HTML or RDF, the same expectations apply to make the web grow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse URIs as names for things\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDP is an official W3C recommendation. According to \ntheir spec\n, Linked Data Platform (LDP) defines a set of rules for HTTP operations on web resources, some based on RDF, to provide an architecture for read-write Linked Data on the web. Put more simply: An LDP server is a web server that lets you manage relationships in RDF by creating URLs you can perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete)\noperation on:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://my_url/some_resource\n\n\nhttp://my_url/some_resource/children\n\n\nhttp://my_url/some_resource/children/child_resource\n\n\n prefix:isChildOf \nhttp://my_url/some_resource\n\n\n\n\nAn LDP server also lets you request the RDF graph for a resource with varying levels of additional information for discovery:\n\n\n\n\nThe resource itself\n\n\nThe resource plus child resources\n\n\nThe resource plus all other resources that reference it (inbound references)\n\n\nThe resource plus children plus inbound references\n\n\n\n\nFedora 4 is an LDP implementation. It stores metadata using RDF (Resource Description Framework), a standard format for data interchange on the web. RDF data is formatted as triples, like so: \nresource_uri\n \npredicate_uri\n \nobject_uri\n and can be exported in many different formats:\n\n\n\n\nJSON-LD\n\n\nRDF/XML\n\n\nTurtle\n\n\nN-Triples\n\n\n\n\nWorking with RDF is not entirely new in the Islandora/Fedora context, as RELS-EXT and RELS-INT have always been RDF/XML. Related objects can be included in RDF, so it functions as a graph you can traverse in order to discover more information. \n\n\nExample: Dublin Core as XML and RDF using the dc namespace\n\n\nDublin Core XML you store with the resource.\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n?\n\n\nmetadata\n  xmlns=\nhttp://example.org/myapp/\n\n  xmlns:xsi=\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\n\n  xsi:schemaLocation=\nhttp://example.org/myapp/ http://example.org/myapp/schema.xsd\n\n  xmlns:dc=\nhttp://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\n\n  \ndc:title\n\n    Islandora\n  \n/dc:title\n\n  \ndc:description\n\n    Islandora is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework.\n  \n/dc:description\n\n\n/metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nvs RDF (which is actually properties of the resource)\n\n\n@prefix dc: \nhttp://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\n .\n\nhttp://islandora.ca/\n dc:title \nIslandora\n ;\n   dc:description \nIslandora is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework.\n .\n\n\n\n\nInteroperability\n\n\nIslandora CLAW works with the \nPortland Common Data Model\n, \"a flexible, extensible domain model that is intended to underlie a wide array of repository and DAMS applications.\" What does this mean in practice? Objects stored in Islandora CLAW will have a data model that can be recognized by Hydra and other custom Fedora 4 based repository heads, and vice versa. By working together with the Hydra and Fedora communities, we can leverage a broader community of developers, librarians, and other digital repository users to build better tools and share resources.",

All contributions are welcome: use-cases, documentation, code, patches, bug reports, feature requests, etc. You do not need to be a programmer to speak up!\n\n\nWorkflows\n\n\nThe group meets each Wednesday at 1PM Eastern. Meeting notes and announcements are posted to the \nIslandora community list\n and the \nIslandora developers list\n. You can view meeting agendas, notes, and call-in information \nhere\n. Anybody is welcome to join the calls, and add items to the agenda.\n\n\nUse cases\n\n\nIf you would like to submit a use case for the Islandora and Fedora integration project, please submit and issue \nhere\n using the \nUse Case template\n, assign the \"use case\" label to the issue.\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nYou can contribute documentation in two different ways. One way is to create an issue \nhere\n assign the \"documentation\" label to the issue. Another way is to by pull request, same process as \nContribute Code\n. All documentation resides in \ndocs\n.\n\n\nRequest a new feature\n\n\nTo request a new feature you should \nopen an issue\n or create a \nuse case\n (see \nuse case\n section above), and summarize the desired functionality. Select the label \"enhancement\" if creating an issue on the project repo, and \"use case\" if creating a use case in the interest group repo.\n\n\nReport a bug\n\n\nTo report a bug you should \nopen an issue\n that summarizes the bug. Set the label to \"bug\".\n\n\nIn order to help us understand and fix the bug it would be great if you could provide us with:\n\n\n\n\nThe steps to reproduce the bug. This includes information about e.g. the Islandora version you were using along with version of stack components.\n\n\nThe expected behavior.\n\n\nThe actual, incorrect behavior.\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to search the issue queue for existing issues (aka tickets) that already describe the problem; if there is such a ticket please add your information as a comment.\n\n\nIf you want to provide a pull along with your bug report:\n\n\nThat is great! In this case please send us a pull request as described in section \nCreate a pull request\n below.\n\n\nContribute code\n\n\nBefore you set out to contribute code you will need to have completed a \nContributor License Agreement\n or be covered by a \nCorporate Contributor Licencse Agreement\n. The signed copy of the license agreement should be sent to \n\n\nIf you are interested in contributing code to Islandora but do not know where to begin:\n\n\nIn this case you should \nbrowse open issues\n, and or \nuse cases\n.\n\n\nIf you are contributing Drupal code, it must adhere to \nDrupal Coding Standards\n; Travis CI will check for this on pull requests.\n\n\nContributions to the Islandora codebase should be sent as GitHub pull requests. See section \nCreate a pull request\n below for details. If there is any problem with the pull request we can work through it using the commenting features of GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nFor \nsmall patches\n, feel free to submit pull requests directly for those patches.\n\n\n\n\nFor \nlarger code contributions\n, please use the following process. The idea behind this process is to prevent any wasted work and catch design issues early on.\n\n\n\n\nOpen an issue\n and assign it the label of \"enhancement\", if a similar issue does not exist already. If a similar issue does exist, then you may consider participating in the work on the existing issue.\n\n\nComment on the issue with your plan for implementing the issue. Explain what pieces of the codebase you are going to touch and how everything is going to fit together.\n\n\nIslandora committers will work with you on the design to make sure you are on the right track.\n\n\nImplement your issue, create a pull request (see below), and iterate from there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a pull request\n\n\nTake a look at \nCreating a pull request\n. In a nutshell you need to:\n\n\n\n\nFork\n the Islandora GitHub repository at \nhttps://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW\n to your personal GitHub account. If you already have a fork of \nhttps://github.com/Islandora/islandora\n Github will prevent you from creating a new fork; in such a case you can continue to use \nhttps://github.com/Islandora/islandora\n to issue pull request, be cautious of which branches you work from though (you'll want to base your work off of 7.x-2.x). Also be cautious of which repository your issuing your Pull Request to (you'll want to issue your pull request to \nhttps://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW\n). See \nFork a repo\n for detailed instructions.\n\n\nCommit any changes to your fork.\n\n\nSend a \npull request\n to the Islandora GitHub repository that you forked in step 1.  If your pull request is related to an existing issue -- for instance, because you reported a \nbug/issue\n earlier -- prefix the title of your pull request with the corresponding issue number (e.g. \nissue-123: ...\n). Please also include a reference to the issue in the description of the pull. This can be done by using '#' plus the issue number like so '#123', also try to pick an appropriate name for the branch in which you're issuing the pull request from. \n\n\n\n\nYou may want to read \nSyncing a fork\n for instructions on how to keep your fork up to date with the latest changes of the upstream (official) \nislandora\n repository.\n\n\nLicense Agreements\n\n\nThe Islandora Foundation requires that contributors complete a \nContributor License Agreement\n or be covered by a \nCorporate Contributor Licencse Agreement\n. The signed copy of the license agreement should be sent to \ncommunity@islandora.ca\n.

Also be cautious of which repository your issuing your Pull Request to (you'll want to issue your pull request to  https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW ). See  Fork a repo  for detailed instructions.  Commit any changes to your fork.  Send a  pull request  to the Islandora GitHub repository that you forked in step 1.  If your pull request is related to an existing issue -- for instance, because you reported a  bug/issue  earlier -- prefix the title of your pull request with the corresponding issue number (e.g.  issue-123: ... ). Please also include a reference to the issue in the description of the pull. This can be done by using '#' plus the issue number like so '#123', also try to pick an appropriate name for the branch in which you're issuing the pull request from.

This folder points to your Islandora CLAW github repo on your computer and is available at \n~/CLAW\n (\n/home/vagrant/CLAW\n) on the virtual machine. On top of that, in Drupal, \nsites/all/modules/islandora\n is a symlink pointing to \n~/CLAW/islandora\n.  This has a few profound consequences:\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the IDE you're comfortable with on your own machine, without the need to scp/rsync code over to the development environment\n\n\nChanges to Drupal module code are automatically reflected on your Drupal site since that code is symlinked (although you may need to be ssh'd in to \ndrush cc all\n on occassion)\n\n\nWhen testing the Vagrant install after adding changes, the code from your fork and your branch on your computer is used to generate the virtual machine\n\n\n\n\nCompiling Camel Bundles\n\n\nDespite being nothing but Blueprint xml files, Camel projects still have to be compiled using Maven. The \ninstall\n directive is the default, so all one has to do is navigate to the appropriate directory and issue a \nmvn\n in the command line.  For example, to compile the collection service:\n\n\n~ $ cd /path/to/CLAW/Alpaca/services/collection-service\n/path/to/CLAW/Alpaca/serices/collection-service $ mvn\n\n\n\n\nThe only caveat here is that this is best done on the virtual machine itself. While your virtual machine was being built, it's Karaf installation was set to monitor the vagrant user's Maven repository for changes, and autodeploy in response to \nmvn install\n. So while you can always run Maven from your own machine, it will get installed in your personal Maven repository on your machine. So to take advantage of the auto-redeploy capabilities of Karaf, you need to do this as the vagrant user.\n\n\nIf for any reason, you have to shutdown or restart Karaf, it will cease to monitor the vagrant user's Maven repository. In order to turn this back on, you'll have to issue the appropriate commands to get monitoring working again. The easiest way to do this is to re-run the karaf script the install process uses to set up monitoring by executing \n/opt/karaf/bin/client \n ~/islandora/install/karaf/monitor.script\n.",

This has a few profound consequences:   You can use the IDE you're comfortable with on your own machine, without the need to scp/rsync code over to the development environment  Changes to Drupal module code are automatically reflected on your Drupal site since that code is symlinked (although you may need to be ssh'd in to  drush cc all  on occassion)  When testing the Vagrant install after adding changes, the code from your fork and your branch on your computer is used to generate the virtual machine",

While your virtual machine was being built, it's Karaf installation was set to monitor the vagrant user's Maven repository for changes, and autodeploy in response to  mvn install . So while you can always run Maven from your own machine, it will get installed in your personal Maven repository on your machine. So to take advantage of the auto-redeploy capabilities of Karaf, you need to do this as the vagrant user.  If for any reason, you have to shutdown or restart Karaf, it will cease to monitor the vagrant user's Maven repository. In order to turn this back on, you'll have to issue the appropriate commands to get monitoring working again.

Because Fedora 4 is a vastly different platform than Fedora 3, so too is Islandora 7.x-2.x a major departure from what came before. Switching to 7.x-2.x represents not just a typical upgrade with improvements, features, and bug fixes, but rather a major shift in how objects are stored and managed. \n\n\nMoving from Islandora 7.x-1.x to 7.x-2.x requires a migration of objects, which you can learn about \nhere\n. It also requires some adjustments in how you think about your objects and their relationships, and how to manage them in Islandora, which we will cover below.\n\n\nYou can also check out some of the documentation provided by the Fedora project:\n\n \nConcept Mapping - Fedora 3 to 4\n\n\n \nThe Fedora 4 object model\n\n\n \nFedora 3 to 4 Upgration\n\n\n \nLDP-PCDM-F4 In Action\n\n\nFedora\n\n\nRepository Structure\n\n\nFedora 3 stored all objects at the top level of the repository, although presentation of the objects could mimic a directory structure by having objects 'in' collections and collections 'in' other collections. This image is a helpful oversimplification:\n\n\n\n\nFedora 4 differs considerably in that there is an innate tree hierarchy to the repository rather than a flat structure. Put less simply, \"a Fedora 4 repository consists of a directed acyclic graph of resources where edges represent a parent-child relation\" (\nFedora 4\n).\n\n\nObject Structure\n\n\nFedora 3 objects are FOXML (Fedora Object eXtensible Markup Language) documents, with three elements:\n\n\n\n\nDigital Object Identifier\n: A unique, persistent identifier for the digital object. Also knowns as the PID.\n\n\nSystem Properties\n: A set of system-defined descriptive properties that is necessary to manage and track the object in the repository.\n\n\nDatastream(s)\n: The element in a Fedora digital object that represents a content item.\n\n\n\n\nIn Fedora 4 , what we would have called \nobjects\n are now referred to as \nresources\n and are not composed of XML; instead, they are stored in ModeShape as nodes with RDF properties. They can contain the following elements:\n\n\n\n\nContainer\n: Roughly equivalent to a Fedora 3 object - a conceptual representation of a thing that can contain files or other containers.\n\n\nNon-RDF Source\n: Roughly equivalent to a datastream. A Non-RDF Source (or binary) is simply a bitstream (e.g. JPG, PDF, XML, MP3, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nDatastreams\n\n\nIn Islandora 7.x-2.x, RDF datastreams (RELS-EXT and RELS-INT) are stored as pure RDF in Fedora. Binary datastreams (files, images) are files or \nnonRdfResources\n (see \nPCDM\n). Metadata datastreams (MODS, DC, DwC, PBCore, etc) are whatever you want them to be: either binary files of XML, or mapped to your choice of RDF.\n\n\nPIDs\n\n\nEvery object in a Fedora 3 repository had a Persistent Identifier following the pattern \nnamespace:pid\n. Fedora 4 resources do not have PIDs. Instead, since Fedora 4 is an LDP server, their identifiers are fundamentally their URIs. The PIDs of objects migrated from a Fedora 3 repository can still be stored in Fedora 4, as additional properties on the new Fedora 4 resource.\n\n\nSince resources are stored as \nnodes\n on the Drupal side of Islandora 7.x-2.x, they also have Drupal UUIDs.\n\n\nIslandora\n\n\nIngest\n\n\nIn Fedora 3:\n\n Go to a collection\n\n Click \nManage\n\n\n Add an object\n\n Fill out a metadata form\n* Upload object/Ingest\n\n\nIn Fedora 4:\n\n Click \nAdd Content\n (like any Drupal node)\n\n Select content type \n\n Fill out a metadata form\n    * Add thumbnail, select parent collection, upload object, configure standard Drupal node options (comments, url path, etc)\n\n Ingest occurs asynchronously soon after. \n\n\nCollections\n\n\nBecause objects in Fedora 3 were stored in a flat graph structure instead of a hierarchy, what were presented as collection in Islandora 7.x-1.x were actually objects on the same level as their child objects, with the 'container' or 'folder' aspect of them being a fiction for display created by the relationships between the objects. In Fedora 4, resources do have a true hierarchical structure and must have a \nfedora:hasParent\n relationship to know where they belong in a given repository. Indeed, to migrate objects over from Fedora 3 to Fedora 4, parents must arrive before their children. In its current incarnation, all objects in a 7.x-2.x repository have the Fedora root as a parent and relationships are managed via the \npcdm:hasMember\n predicate. \n\n\nIn its current incarnation, Islandora 7.x-2.x does not include a default display for collections.

Hello Drupal Field UI\n\n\nThose Islandorians that have used (and love) the XML Form Builder will notice a substantial difference in how forms are constructed and \nhow the fields are displayed\n. The full functionality of the XML Form Builder is not replicated in the 7.x-2.x version of Islandora yet, so help the community with working that out.\n\n\nDrupal Field UI\n\n\nTo use Islandora-speak the ingest form is now a Drupal content type and a content type is built using Drupal's Field UI. Readers should first review the \nassociated Drupal documentation\n as it provides a foundational understanding of content types and their fields.  \n\n\n\n\nOnce you have created content with your content type, it is very difficult to change so planning and modelling your data before hand is important.\n\n\n\n\nEach field has:\n\n\n\n\na label\n\n\neg. \nDC Title\n\n\n\n\n\n\na machine name\n\n\neg. \nfield_dc_title\n\n\nnote Drupal powered vs Islandora XML Forms:\n\n\nonce you have created/defined a field in a content type, \nyou can reuse that field in other content types\n  \n\n\nAs an example you can create a field for Dublin Core DCMI types and then use that field in any other content type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe type of data to be stored\n\n\neg. \nLong Text\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe widget or form element used to enter/edit the data\n\n\neg. \nText area (multiple rows)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Basic Image Fields\n\n\nDepending on the Widget selected, you will define further properties for the field you've created.\n\n\nEditing the Basic Image Content Type\n\n\nRearranging fields\n\n\nThe Drupal Field UI allows you to easily rearrange fields in the order you wish to present them to the user. In the screenshot above you'll note that I've dragged the DC Title field to the top of the list of fields. Don't forget to \nSave\n your changes.\n\n\nEditing an existing field\n\n\nAs an example if we want to edit the DC Title field, select \nEdit\n from the operations column for that field.  The Edit tab for the field displays the editable properties including:\n\n\n\n\nis it a Required Field?\n\n\nan option to provide or update Help text for the field to guide user or explain the data entry practice for the field.\n\n\nthe type of text filter to apply.\n\n\nprovide a default value for the field\n\n\npermissions for the field (who can edit and/or view it)\n\n\nrdf mapping for the field\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Edit Tab\n\n\nIf your field has existing data (eg. you created content using the content type already), then the changes you can apply to the field are somewhat limited.\n\n\nThe Field Settings tab for the DC Title field warns the user that it can't be changed because data already exists in that field. That's why planning your fields and defining their properties is so important.\n\n\n\n\nField Settings Tab\n\n\nDepending on the field type selected, different widgets may be displayed.\n\n\n\n\nField Widget Tab\n\n\nAdding a new field\n\n\nAdding a simple select field\n\n\nOne of the ways to improve the user experience, data quality, and faceted displays with forms is to provide select or autocomplete options for your users.  As an example, the goal of these steps is to add a select field to your content type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new field called Image Type, with a Field Type of List (Text) and a Widget of Select List.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll need some terms for our Image Type field. Whenever possible it is best to use a standard vocabulary (and if it is linked data friendly even better). As an example we'll use the Library of Congress' \nResource Types vocabulary for Still Image\n to provide three terms for our select list: Drawing, Photograph, and Print. These are added as key value pairs - eg.

            "text": "Islandora Commands\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nSometimes you need to do deeper logic in a Camel route than can realistically be done within a Blueprint XML. Since Apache Camel is an \nintegration\n framework, we can call out to command line PHP instead of having to use Java for the majority of our tasks. Though Java is still always an option to those who are inclined (and may be required for more advanced use cases), there are many advantages to sticking with PHP. Not only is it the language we're most comfortable with as a community, but its also well suited for dealing with both JSON-LD from Fedora and node content from Drupal (much more so than Java). We also get the full advantages of modern PHP, including object oriented programming and tools like Composer. \n\n\nBasic Usage\n\n\nIn your git project's root, head on over to the \nbin\n folder of the \ncamel/commands\n directory and execute the \nislandora.php\n script to see what it has to say.\n\n\nvagrant@islandora:~/islandora$ cd camel/commands/bin\nvagrant@islandora:~/islandora/camel/commands/bin$ php islandora.php\nIslandora Command Tool version 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n\nUsage:\n command [options] [arguments]\n\nOptions:\n -h, --help      Display this help message\n -q, --quiet      Do not output any message\n -V, --version     Display this application version\n   --ansi      Force ANSI output\n   --no-ansi     Disable ANSI output\n -n, --no-interaction Do not ask any interactive question\n -v|vv|vvv, --verbose Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug\n\nAvailable commands:\n help              Displays help for a command\n list              Lists commands\n collectionService\n collectionService:nodeToSparql Converts Drupal node JSON for a collection to a SPARQL Update query\n rdf\n rdf:createNode         Creates a Drupal node from Fedora RDF.\n rdf:extractContentType     Extracts a Drupal content type from Fedora RDF.\n rdf:updateNode         Updates a Drupal node from Fedora RDF.\n\n\n\n\nWow, that's a lot. How did we get all that nice output? It's because we're using the Symfony Console component as a framework for our script. We get all kinds of stuff for free because of it, including versioning, exception catching, and this helpful message.\n\n\nAs you can see, this tool expects a command to be provided. Notice that the commands are even namespaced! Normally, commands would accept arguments and parameters optionally after the command. But from Camel, message bodies are piped to the tool using STDIN, which the tool will gladly accept. Let's try running a command that will convert a node represented in JSON from Drupal into a SPARQL update query. First, we'll save the input to a file so that when we run the command we can just dump its contents into STDIN to emulate how Camel behaves.

Executing commands like this is a great way to test without having to trigger anything via Camel.\n\n\nIf you are within a Camel route in the Blueprint DSL, the message body is automatically provided to the command, and you can utilize the Islandora component to execute one like so:\n\n\nto uri=\nislandora:namespace:command\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in order to run the same command we just did from inside Camel, you can simply do this (assuming the message body is the same JSON data from Drupal services):\n\n\nto uri=\nislandora:collectionService:nodeToSparql\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the documentation on the Islandora command for more information about using a command from within Camel.\n\n\nCreating a new Command\n\n\nLet's go through the steps required to make your own Camel command. As is tradition, we're going to make a simple \"Hello World\" command.\n\n\nAll that's required for creating a command is to extend IslandoraCommand (or one of its subclasses). It already handles everything for you, including accepting input from STDIN. The bare minimum that is required of an IslandoraCommand is to implement two methods: \nconfigure()\n and \nexecute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)\n. From your project's root, create the \ncamel/commands/src/Greeter\n directory and open up a new file called \nHelloGreeter.php\n. Place the following code inside and be sure to save it to the newly created \nGreeter\n directory.\n\n\n\n\n?php\n\n/**\n * This file is part of Islandora.\n *\n * For the full copyright and license information, please view the LICENSE\n * file that was distributed with this source code.\n *\n * PHP Version 5.5.9\n *\n * @category Islandora\n * @package Islandora\\Greeter\n * @author  Your Name \nyour_email@your_employer.com\n\n * @license http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html GPL\n * @link   http://www.islandora.ca\n */\n\nuse Islandora\\IslandoraCommand;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\OutputInterface;\n\n/**\n * Says hello!\n *\n * @category Islandora\n * @package Islandora\\Greeter\n * @author  Your Name \nyour_email@your_employer.com\n\n * @license http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html GPL\n * @link   http://www.islandora.ca\n */\nclass HelloGreeter extends IslandoraCommand\n{\n  /**\n   * Sets command configuration.\n   *\n   * @return null\n   */\n  protected function configure()\n  {\n    $this-\nsetName('greeter:hello')\n      -\nsetDescription(\n        \nSays hello!\n\n      );\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Says hello!\n   *\n   * @param InputInterface $input An InputInterface instance\n   * @param OutputInterface $output An OutputInterface instance\n   *\n   * @return null\n   */\n  protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)\n  {\n    $name = $this-\ndata;\n    $output-\nwriteln(\nHello \n . trim($name) . \n!\n);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nconfigure()\n method, we set some properties for the command. A command's setters all return the command itself, so we can chain the calls together. We set the name of the command, complete with namespace and ':' delimiter. We also give a description of the command that will show up when listing available commands.\n\n\nThe \nexecute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)\n method is where we do our actual work. Since we extended Islandora command, all input from STDIN is provided as a String and can be accessed any time through \n$this-\ndata\n.\n\n\nSo let's try it out! Go back to the \ncamel/commands/bin\n directory and get a listing of all the commands to make sure it appears.\n\n\nvagrant@islandora:~/islandora/camel/commands/bin$ cd ~/islandora/camel/commands/bin\nvagrant@islandora:~/islandora/camel/commands/bin$ php islandora.php\nIslandora Command Tool version 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n\nUsage:\n command [options] [arguments]\n\nOptions:\n -h, --help      Display this help message\n -q, --quiet      Do not output any message\n -V, --version     Display this application version\n   --ansi      Force ANSI output\n   --no-ansi     Disable ANSI output\n -n, --no-interaction Do not ask any interactive question\n -v|vv|vvv, --verbose Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug\n\nAvailable commands:\n help              Displays help for a command\n list              Lists commands\n collectionService\n collectionService:nodeToSparql Converts Drupal node JSON for a collection to a SPARQL Update query\n greeter\n greeter:hello          Says hello!\n rdf\n rdf:createNode         Creates a Drupal node from Fedora RDF.\n rdf:extractContentType     Extracts a Drupal content type from Fedora RDF.\n rdf:updateNode         Updates a Drupal node from Fedora RDF.\n\n\n\n\nAnd sure enough, it does! We now have the \ngreeter:hello\n command from the \ngreeter\n namespace! Let's use it! As is tradition, we're going to greet the world.\n\n\nvagrant@islandora:~/islandora/camel/commands/bin$ echo \nWorld\n | php islandora.php greeter:hello\nHello World!\n\n\n\n\nWorking with JSON data\n\n\nMost of the time, we're dealing with JSON output. Often, we're working with node data from Drupal or ld+json RDF from Fedora 4. As a convienence, the JsonInputIslandoraCommand can be extended instead of IslandoraCommand. With a JsonInputIslandoraCommand, \n$this-\ndata\n is an associative array that is automatically parsed from JSON input through STDIN. Let's trying writing another Greeter, only this time it will accept JSON input of the form \n{\"name\": \"some_name\"}\n.\n\n\n?php\n\n/**\n * This file is part of Islandora.\n *\n * For the full copyright and license information, please view the LICENSE\n * file that was distributed with this source code.\n *\n * PHP Version 5.5.9\n *\n * @category Islandora\n * @package Islandora\\Greeter\n * @author  Your Name \nyour_email@your_employer.com\n\n * @license http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html GPL\n * @link   http://www.islandora.ca\n */\n\nuse Islandora\\JsonInputIslandoraCommand;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\OutputInterface;\n\n/**\n * Says hello!

That's how you can create your own commands for use in Camel routes, and also how to experiment with them outside of Camel!

Since Apache Camel is an  integration  framework, we can call out to command line PHP instead of having to use Java for the majority of our tasks. Though Java is still always an option to those who are inclined (and may be required for more advanced use cases), there are many advantages to sticking with PHP. Not only is it the language we're most comfortable with as a community, but its also well suited for dealing with both JSON-LD from Fedora and node content from Drupal (much more so than Java).

Wow, that's a lot. How did we get all that nice output? It's because we're using the Symfony Console component as a framework for our script. We get all kinds of stuff for free because of it, including versioning, exception catching, and this helpful message.  As you can see, this tool expects a command to be provided. Notice that the commands are even namespaced! Normally, commands would accept arguments and parameters optionally after the command. But from Camel, message bodies are piped to the tool using STDIN, which the tool will gladly accept. Let's try running a command that will convert a node represented in JSON from Drupal into a SPARQL update query. First, we'll save the input to a file so that when we run the command we can just dump its contents into STDIN to emulate how Camel behaves. Go find a node on your site and get its UUID by looking at its devel tab.   PUT PICTURE OF DEVEL TAB HERE  You can get its JSON representation by visiting  http://yoursite/islandora/node/your_nodes_uuid . If you're running on the vagrant environment, and have a uuid of 38f7d551-28f7-49ac-9ceb-d6adcc6cc9c0, then the url would look like  localhost:8000/islandora/node/38f7d551-28f7-49ac-9ceb-d6adcc6cc9c0 .  PUT A PICTURE OF THE JSON OUTPUT HERE  Save the response somewhere, like  /tmp/node.json .

Place the following code inside and be sure to save it to the newly created  Greeter  directory.   ?php\n\n/**\n * This file is part of Islandora.\n *\n * For the full copyright and license information, please view the LICENSE\n * file that was distributed with this source code.\n *\n * PHP Version 5.5.9\n *\n * @category Islandora\n * @package Islandora\\Greeter\n * @author  Your Name  your_email@your_employer.com \n * @license http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html GPL\n * @link   http://www.islandora.ca\n */\n\nuse Islandora\\IslandoraCommand;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\OutputInterface;\n\n/**\n * Says hello!\n *\n * @category Islandora\n * @package Islandora\\Greeter\n * @author  Your Name  your_email@your_employer.com \n * @license http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html GPL\n * @link   http://www.islandora.ca\n */\nclass HelloGreeter extends IslandoraCommand\n{\n  /**\n   * Sets command configuration.\n   *\n   * @return null\n   */\n  protected function configure()\n  {\n    $this- setName('greeter:hello')\n      - setDescription(\n         Says hello! \n      );\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Says hello!\n   *\n   * @param InputInterface $input An InputInterface instance\n   * @param OutputInterface $output An OutputInterface instance\n   *\n   * @return null\n   */\n  protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)\n  {\n    $name = $this- data;\n    $output- writeln( Hello   . trim($name) .  ! );\n  }\n}  In the  configure()  method, we set some properties for the command. A command's setters all return the command itself, so we can chain the calls together. We set the name of the command, complete with namespace and ':' delimiter. We also give a description of the command that will show up when listing available commands.  The  execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)  method is where we do our actual work. Since we extended Islandora command, all input from STDIN is provided as a String and can be accessed any time through  $this- data .  So let's try it out! Go back to the  camel/commands/bin  directory and get a listing of all the commands to make sure it appears.  vagrant@islandora:~/islandora/camel/commands/bin$ cd ~/islandora/camel/commands/bin\nvagrant@islandora:~/islandora/camel/commands/bin$ php islandora.php\nIslandora Command Tool version 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n\nUsage:\n command [options] [arguments]\n\nOptions:\n -h, --help      Display this help message\n -q, --quiet      Do not output any message\n -V, --version     Display this application version\n   --ansi      Force ANSI output\n   --no-ansi     Disable ANSI output\n -n, --no-interaction Do not ask any interactive question\n -v|vv|vvv, --verbose Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug\n\nAvailable commands:\n help              Displays help for a command\n list              Lists commands\n collectionService\n collectionService:nodeToSparql Converts Drupal node JSON for a collection to a SPARQL Update query\n greeter\n greeter:hello          Says hello!\n rdf\n rdf:createNode         Creates a Drupal node from Fedora RDF.\n rdf:extractContentType     Extracts a Drupal content type from Fedora RDF.\n rdf:updateNode         Updates a Drupal node from Fedora RDF.
